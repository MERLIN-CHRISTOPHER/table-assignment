                            The grandeur of Chola dynasty is still intact in the form of divine Adi Kumbeswarar temple. It’s an exquisite Dravidian style masterpiece which was renovated by Govinda Dikshitar, chief of Achutha Nayakar of Thanjavur in 16th century AD. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva.

                            Holy Domain to embrace Ethereal
                            The temple of Adi Kumbeswarar is also considered as the 26th Paadal Petra Sthalam during Chola Period. Devotees from all over the world take bath in the Potramarai tank during Mahamaham festival which is celebrated once in every 12 years (It is called as Kumbh Mela in North).
                            
                            The divine Shiva Lingam will blow your heart away, it is narrow at the top like a needle and broad at the bottom. On the left side of Kumbeswarar, his consort Goddess Mangalambika showers her divine blessings to the devotees.

                                        The ‘Brihadeeswarar Temple’ is a delightful abode of Lord Shiva and is located in the Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu. It is one of the largest temples in India. This brilliant creation of the Chola dynasty in the 11th century AD stands tall as a testimony to the opulence and grandeur of the Chola rulers.

                                        Today, the temple enjoys the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the list of ‘Great Living Chola Temples’ and is visited by hundreds of thousands of devotees and tourists every year.
                                        
                                        Architecture Glory
                                        The temple tower is 216 ft long which is considered as the tallest temple tower in the world. The ‘Kumbam’ or the apex structure on top of the Vimana, weighing 80 tonnes carved from a single granite, just adds to the magnificence of the entire structure.
                                        
                                        Also, the Brihadeeswarar Temple has another feather to it with an acclaim of being the world’s first temple completely built from granite. With no granite quarry within 100 km. radius of the temple, a visit to this temple definitely makes one wonder about the logistics and efforts that must have been required to transport tonnes of granite to this site.
